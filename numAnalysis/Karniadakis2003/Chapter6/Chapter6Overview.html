<blockquote>In this chapter we consider implicit discretizations of space- 
 and time-derivatives. &nbsp;Unlike the explicit discretizations presented 
 in the previous chapter, here we express a derivative at one grid point in
 terms of function values <i>as well as derivative values</i> at adjacent 
grid points (spatial discretization) or in terms of previous <i>and current</i> 
 time levels (temporal discretization). &nbsp;This, in turn, implies that 
there is implicit coupling, and thus matrix inversion is required to obtain 
the solution.<br>
     <br>
   The material of this chapter serves to introduce solutions of tridiagonal 
 systems and correspondingly parallel computing of sparse linear systems using
 MPI.&nbsp; We also introduce two new MPI functions: <i>MPI_Barrier,</i> used
 for synchronizing processes, and <i>MPI_Wtime,</i> used for obtaining the
 wallclock timing information.<br>

<h4><font size="+2">SCchapter6 Introduction and Chapter 6 Driver Programs</font></h4>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the text, there are several places where the 
<i>software suite</i> is referenced. &nbsp;In some cases the code is explicitly 
placed within the text, and at other times within the text we merely alert 
you that the software is available on this CD. &nbsp;As you read through Chapter
6, you will find that the following function/classes were discussed. <br>
    </div>
  <br>
   
<blockquote>      
  <ul>
      <li> Section 6.1.4: void ThomasAlgorithm(int N, double *b, double *a,
 double *c, double *x, double *q) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 6.1.4: void ThomasAlgorithLU(int N, double *b, double
*a,  double *c, double *l, double *u, double *d) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 6.1.4: void ThomasAlgorithm_per(int N, double *b, double
 *a, double *c, double *x, double *q) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 6.1.5: void ThomasAlgorithm_P(int mynode, int numnodes, 
int N, double *b, double *a, double *c, double *x, double *q) function definition</li>
       
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; The declarations and definitions of these functions/classes
 can be found in the following files:<br>
  <br>
   
<blockquote>Go to the file <a href="../SCchapter6.h">SCchapter6.h</a> for
 function/class declarations   <br>
   </blockquote>
     
<blockquote>Go to the file <a href="../SCchapter6.cpp">SCchapter6.cpp</a>
 for function/class definitions<br>
   </blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case that an entire program (meaning
that  a main() function is provided) is presented in the text, we classify
this  as a driver program. &nbsp;Unlike the functions/classes above, driver
programs  are complete C++ programs which can be compiled and executed. &nbsp;As
you  read through the book, you will see that driver programs are often times
created by using functions/classes which are in the SCchapter files. &nbsp;We
denote driver programs which are explicitly given in the text of the book
in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>. &nbsp;In some chapters, we present very
few driver programs explicitly in the text, however we provide some example
driver programs which demonstrate how to use the functions/classes with in
SCchapter files. &nbsp;Such driver programs are denoted in black.<br>
