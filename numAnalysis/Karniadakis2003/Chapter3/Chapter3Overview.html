<blockquote>            
  <div align="left">Two of the most common tasks in scientific computing
are interpolation of discrete data and approximation by known functions of
the numerical solution, the source terms, and the boundary or initial conditions.
  &nbsp;Therefore, we need to perform these tasks both accurately and efficiently.
  &nbsp;The data are not always nicely distributed on a uniform lattice or
 grid, and thus we must learn how to manage these situations as well. We
often  use polynomials to represent discrete data as they are easy to "manipulate,''
  i.e., differentiate and integrate. &nbsp;However, <i>sines</i> and <i>cosines</i>
  as well as special functions, called <i>wavelets,</i> are very effective
 means to perform interpolation and approximation, and they have very interesting
  properties.<br>
      <br>
    In this section, we will study different such representations and their 
 corresponding C++ implementations. &nbsp;We consider cases where the data 
 are just sufficient to determine exactly the representation (deterministic 
 case) as well as cases where the data are more than the information needed 
 (overdetermined case).<br>
      <br>
    Finally, we will present a more detailed discussion of <i>MPI_Send</i>
 and    <i>MPI_Recv,</i> the two fundamental building blocks of MPI.</div>

<div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the text, there are several places
where the <i>software suite</i> is referenced. &nbsp;In some cases the code
is explicitly placed within the text, and at other times within the text
we merely alert you that the software is available on this CD. &nbsp;As you
read through Chapter 3, you will find that the following function/classes 
 were discussed.<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp; The declarations and definitions of these functions/classes 
 can be found in the following files:<br>
    <br>
       
<blockquote>Go to the file <a href="../SCchapter3.h">SCchapter3.h</a> for 
 function/class declarations   <br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case that an entire program (meaning 
that  a main() function is provided) is presented in the text, we classify 
this  as a driver program. &nbsp;Unlike the functions/classes above, driver 
programs  are complete C++ programs which can be compiled and executed. &nbsp;As 
you  read through the book, you will see that driver programs are often times 
created by using functions/classes which are in the SCchapter files. &nbsp;We 
denote driver programs which are explicitly given in the text of the book 
in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>. &nbsp;In some chapters, we present very 
few driver programs explicitly in the text, however we provide some example 
driver programs which demonstrate how to use the functions/classes with in 
SCchapter files. &nbsp;Such driver programs are denoted in black.<br>
