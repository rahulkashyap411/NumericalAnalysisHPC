<blockquote>We have already discussed how to solve tridiagonal linear systems
  of equations using direct solvers (the Thomas algorithm) in chapter 6 and
  some iterative solvers (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR and multigrid) in chapter
  7. &nbsp;We have also discussed solutions of nonlinear and linear systems
  and have introduced the conjugate gradient method in chapter 4. &nbsp;In
 the current chapter we revisit this subject and present general algorithms
 for the <i>direct</i> and <i>iterative</i> solution of large linear systems.
 &nbsp;We start with the classical Gaussian &nbsp;elimination (which is a
fast solver!) and then proceed with more sophisticated solvers and preconditioners
 for symmetric and non-symmetric systems.<br>
      <br>
    In parallel computing, we introduce the broadcasting command <i>MPI_Bcast,</i>
  and demonstrate its usefulness in the context of Gaussian elimination.&nbsp;
  In addition, we reiterate the use of <i>MPI_Send,</i> <i>MPI_Recv,</i>
  <i>MPI_Allgather,</i>   and <i>MPI_Allreduce</i> through example implementations
of algorithms presented   in this chapter.<br>

<h4><font size="+2">SCchapter9 Introduction and Chapter 9 Driver Programs</font></h4>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the text, there are several places where the 
<i>software suite</i> is referenced. &nbsp;In some cases the code is explicitly 
placed within the text, and at other times within the text we merely alert 
you that the software is available on this CD. &nbsp;As you read through Chapter
9, you will find that the following function/classes were discussed. <br>
        <br>
  </div>
   
<blockquote>      
  <ul>
      <li>  Section 9.1.2: void GaussElimination(SCMatrix &amp;A, SCVector 
&amp;b, int pivotflag) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 9.3.1: void Hessenberg(SCMatrix &amp;A) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 9.5.1: void ModifiedArnoldi(int m, const SCMatrix &amp;A,
 SCMatrix &amp;H, SCMatrix &amp;V) function definition</li>
      <li> Section 9.5.3: void GMRES(int m, const SCMatrix &amp;A, const
SCVector  &amp;b, SCVector &amp;x) function definition</li>
       
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The declarations and definitions of these functions/classes
 can be found in the following files:<br>
   <br>
     
<blockquote>Go to the file <a href="../SCchapter9.h">SCchapter9.h</a> for
 function/class declarations   <br>
   </blockquote>
     
<blockquote>Go to the file <a href="../SCchapter9.cpp">SCchapter9.cpp</a>
 for function/class definitions<br>
   </blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case that an entire program (meaning
that  a main() function is provided) is presented in the text, we classify
this  as a driver program. &nbsp;Unlike the functions/classes above, driver
programs  are complete C++ programs which can be compiled and executed. &nbsp;As
you  read through the book, you will see that driver programs are often times
created by using functions/classes which are in the SCchapter files. &nbsp;We
denote driver programs which are explicitly given in the text of the book
in <font color="#ff0000">red</font>. &nbsp;In some chapters, we present very
few driver programs explicitly in the text, however we provide some example
driver programs which demonstrate how to use the functions/classes with in
SCchapter files. &nbsp;Such driver programs are denoted in black.<br>
